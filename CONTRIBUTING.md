hello hello

I'd definitely love to open this up for external contributions, but there's parts of the codebase I'm still embarassed about I wanna clean up first. There's no real docs right now, but basically all the magic currently happens in the `SuperElection` class and I try to cache as much of the math as possible, but still need to clean up a lot of the algorithms.
