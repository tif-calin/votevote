hello hello

I'd definitely love to open this up for external contributions, but there's parts of the codebase I'm still embarassed about I wanna clean up first. There's no real docs right now, but basically all the magic currently happens in the `SuperElection` class and I try to cache as much of the math as possible, but still need to clean up a lot of the algorithms.

## Ways you can help
 - **Testing**! If you doubt some of these results and have an urge to calculate an expected result by hand, I'd love to hear about it. I can codify your simulation into automated tests. These tests will run in all future versions of the algorithm as well so it'll ensure that changes I might make to it don't cause unexpected results.
   - _BTW you can see the voter preferences of any given voter by hovering over them in the voter display._
